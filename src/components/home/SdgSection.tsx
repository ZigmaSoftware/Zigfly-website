  { id: 2, name: "Zero Hunger", color: "#D4A23C", contribution: "BSF larvae produce protein-rich biomass with 30–40% protein content, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional fish meal and animal feed. The manure and frass generated serve as natural fertilizers, improving agricultural productivity and contributing directly to food security.", img: sdg02 },
  { id: 3, name: "Good Health", color: "#4C9F38", contribution: "By scientifically processing wet waste at source, the technology eliminates open dumping and the associated breeding of disease vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, and rodents. This directly improves public health outcomes in urban areas. The process also suppresses harmful pathogens in waste, reducing community health risks.", img: sdg03 },
  { id: 6, name: "Clean Water", color: "#26BDE2", contribution: "Unprocessed wet waste is a primary source of leachate contamination of groundwater and surface water bodies. The Zigfly process treats leachate within the facility and converts organic waste before it can contaminate water sources, protecting freshwater ecosystems and supporting sanitation goals.", img: sdg06 },
  { id: 7, name: "Clean Energy", color: "#FDB713", contribution: "The oils extracted from BSF larvae have demonstrated application in biodiesel production, offering a renewable, bio-based energy source derived entirely from waste — contributing to the clean energy transition without competing with food crops.", img: sdg07 },
  { id: 8, name: "Decent Work", color: "#A21942", contribution: "The establishment and operation of BSF processing facilities creates direct employment opportunities across waste collection, plant operations, larvae harvesting, product processing, and marketing. The DBFOO model also stimulates private sector investment in the green economy.", img: sdg08 },
  { id: 9, name: "Innovation", color: "#FD6925", contribution: "BSF bioconversion represents a scientifically advanced, innovative approach to waste management — far superior in speed, efficiency, and output value compared to conventional composting, biogas, or vermicomposting technologies. Zigfly's scalable facility model demonstrates replicable green infrastructure for urban India.", img: sdg09 },
  { id: 11, name: "Sustainable Cities", color: "#FD9D24", contribution: "By partnering with Urban Local Bodies to manage municipal wet waste, the technology directly addresses one of urban India's most persistent environmental challenges. It reduces landfill burden, improves city cleanliness, and supports Swachh Bharat Mission objectives — making cities more liveable and sustainable.", img: sdg11 },
  { id: 12, name: "Responsible Production", color: "#BF8B2E", contribution: "The BSF process is the embodiment of circular economy principles — waste from one system becomes the input for another. With near-zero residue and three commercially valuable outputs, the technology maximises resource recovery and minimises waste generation at every stage of the production chain.", img: sdg12 },
  { id: 13, name: "Climate Action", color: "#3F7E44", contribution: "Research demonstrates that manure treated with BSF larvae produces 47 times lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to windrow composting. By diverting organic waste from landfills — a significant source of methane — the Zigfly process directly reduces the carbon footprint of urban waste management.", img: sdg13 },
  { id: 14, name: "Life Below Water", color: "#0082BD", contribution: "BSF larvae serve as a high-quality, sustainable substitute for fish meal in aquaculture feed. This reduces the pressure on wild fish stocks harvested for conventional feed production, directly protecting marine ecosystems and supporting sustainable aquaculture practices.", img: sdg14 },
  { id: 15, name: "Life on Land", color: "#56C02B", contribution: "The organic manure and frass produced enrich soil health and biodiversity. By reducing dependence on chemical fertilizers and returning nutrients to the soil naturally, the process supports healthier terrestrial ecosystems and sustainable land use.", img: sdg15 },
  { id: 17, name: "Partnerships", color: "#19486A", contribution: "The DBFOO model is built on structured, contractual partnerships between private operators like Zigfly and Urban Local Bodies, demonstrating how public-private collaboration can deliver scalable, sustainable solutions to civic challenges. The model is replicable across municipalities nationwide.", img: sdg17 },
